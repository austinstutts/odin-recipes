        <h4>Step by Step: How to make Pumpkin roll</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bake the cake:</strong>Mix the eggs, sugar, pumpkin, and cinnamon in a bowl. Mix the flour and baking soda in a separate bowl, then add it to the egg mixture. Blend the batter until smooth. Spread the batter in a prepared jelly roll pan. Bake in a preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll the cake:</strong>Invert the cake onto a cotton tea towel. Let the cake cool for about five minutes. Roll the cake up in the towel jelly-roll style. Place the cake seam-side down and allow it to finish cooling.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong>Beat the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, butter, and vanilla in a mixing bowl until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll the cake again:</strong>When the cake is cool, unroll it and evenly spread with the cream cheese mixture. Roll the cake up again without the towel. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving</li>
        </ol>
