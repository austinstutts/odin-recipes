        <h2>What are Snowball cookies?</h2>
        <p>Snowballs, a.k.a. Russian tea cakes or Mexican wedding cookies, are melt-in-your-mouth cookies made with staple ingredients: butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, flour, finely chopped nuts, and salt. The round cookies are rolled in powdered sugar, so they sort of resemble snowballs. The festive treat is often served during the holiday season.</p>
